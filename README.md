What Is It?
============

The data related to two investigations of Blue Coat ProxySG and Packetshaper
installations across the world as collected in early and mid 2013 by Citizen
Lab and our partners. Reported findings can be found [here](https://citizenlab.org/2013/01/planet-blue-coat-mapping-global-censorship-and-surveillance-tools/)
and [here](https://citizenlab.org/2013/07/planet-blue-coat-redux/)

The first investigation took place in early 2013 and is contained in the 01-planet-bluecoat directory
The second investigation took place in mid 2013 and is contained in the 02-deviceswander directory

Summary of Key Findings of Planet BlueCoat Investigation
=========================================================

* Blue Coat Devices capable of filtering, censorship, and surveillance are being used around the world. During several weeks of scanning and validation that ended in January 2013, we uncovered 61 Blue Coat ProxySG devices and 316 Blue Coat PacketShaper appliances, devices with specific functionality permitting filtering, censorship, and surveillance.

* 61 of these Blue Coat appliances are on public or government networks in countries with a history of concerns over human rights, surveillance, and censorship (11 ProxySG and 50 PacketShaper appliances). We found these appliances in the following locations:

* Blue Coat ProxySG: Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE.

* PacketShaper: Afghanistan, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela.
Our findings support the need for national and international scrutiny of Blue Coat implementations in the countries we have identified, and a closer look at the global proliferation of “dual-use” information and communication technologies. Internet service providers responsible for these deployments should consider publicly clarifying their function, and we hope Blue Coat will take this report as an opportunity to explain their due diligence process to ensure that their devices are not used in ways that violate human rights.

Summary of Findings for "Some Devices Wander" Investigation
============================================================

* In this report, our third on Blue Coat Systems, we use a combination of network
measurement and scanning methods and tools to identify instances of Blue Coat
ProxySG and PacketShaper devices. This kind of equipment can be used to secure
and maintain networks, but it can also be used to implement
politically-motivated restrictions on access to information, and monitor and
record private communications.

* We found Blue Coat devices on public networks of 83 countries (20 countries
with both ProxySG and PacketShaper, 56 countries with PacketShaper only, and 7
countries with ProxySG only). Included in these countries are regimes with
questionable human rights records, and three countries that are subject to US
sanctions: Iran, Syria, and Sudan.

* Our findings raise questions around the sale of “dual-use” communication
technologies to national jurisdictions where the implementation of such
technology has not been publicly debated or shaped by the rule of law. The
issues raised by this report go beyond one company and its products and
services, and underscore the imperatives of addressing the global public policy
implications of internationally-marketed communications infrastructure and
services.
